# PR Flow — backlog

> **Planning only.** Captures requested improvements as a prioritized, actionable
> backlog. Check items off as they ship.

> **Constraint:** Once the release gate is satisfied, **no new backlog items** may
> be added before five external developers have used the app for one week.

Legend: 🟢 small · 🟡 medium · 🔴 large/involved · ⏸ post-MVP · ❓ open question.

**Context:** This is a product plan, not a feature wishlist. Superhuman didn't win
because Gmail links opened in Superhuman — it won because **once you were inside,
it felt incredible.** Foundational = fast cache, keyboard navigation, pleasant
review flow. Entry friction is optimizable later.

**Avoid:** optimizing the last 5% of entry (Slack link interception) before
validating the other 95% (the review experience inside the app).

## The real problem

Not: *"How do I intercept every GitHub link?"*

Yes: *"How do I make opening a PR in PR Flow effortless?"*

For v0.1 users (you + ~5 developers), that's already solved:

```
⌘K → "login" → Enter
```

Or resume where you left off. **No Slack link handling required.**

---

## v0.1 — ship this, then stop

- [x] PR list + cached open
- [x] Keyboard navigation
- [x] **`mod+k` PR search** — primary way to open a PR
- [x] Comment + submit review
- [x] **Resume where you left off**
- [ ] Auto-update (before external users)
- [x] Inbox zero-state

**Not in v0.1:** browser extension, link interception, Universal Links, webhooks.

## Backlog tiers

### 🚀 Category 1 — Core product (foundational)

*"Why would someone use this?"*

| Item | Section |
| --- | --- |
| **Resume where you left off** | § flow |
| Cache-first + **perf budget** | § perf |
| Keyboard navigation | § shortcuts |
| **`mod+k` search across PRs** | §6 |
| **New review notification** | § notify |
| Code-first layout + Info tab | § layout |
| Viewed workflow + verdict v1 | §4 |
| Orient banner | § delta |
| PR-level comments in Info + badge | §5 |
| Inbox zero-state | § inbox |
| Remove manual refresh | §7 |
| shadcn Phase 1 | §8 |

### 🏗 Category 2 — Product infrastructure

*"Can people realistically adopt it?"*

| Item | Section | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auto-updates** | §11b | Before external users |
| CI releases + signing | §11b | With auto-update |
| **`prflow://` scheme** | §11a | Stage 2 (simple extension) |

### ✨ Category 3 — Delighters (prove the pain first)

| Item | Section | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple **"Open in PR Flow"** extension | §11a Stage 2 | After daily-use users |
| Link **interception** + native messaging | §11a Stage 3 | Only if users ask |
| Universal Links / wrapper domain | §11a | Unlikely needed if extension suffices |
| New icon · streaks · celebration · Conversation mode | various | Post-MVP |

## Release gate

**Must have before DM'ing five developer friends:**

- [ ] Perf budget met
- [x] Keyboard workflow + stable review
- [x] **Resume where you left off**
- [x] **`mod+k` jump to any PR**
- [ ] **Auto-updates**
- [x] Inbox zero-state

**Can wait until users complain:**

- Browser extension (any kind)
- Slack / GitHub link interception
- Universal Links · webhooks · AI · GitLab · Conversation mode · icon

**Ship rule:** If five developers use it for a week and **nobody** says *"I wish
GitHub links opened this"*, you've saved weeks of integration work.

## Perceived performance budget (north star)

| Action | Goal |
| --- | ---: |
| Open app | < 300 ms |
| Resume last PR | < 300 ms |
| **`mod+k` → open PR** | < 100 ms |
| Switch PR | < 100 ms |
| Switch file | < 16 ms |
| Command palette | Instant |

- [x] 🟡 Dev overlay: `⚡ Last PR open: 84 ms · Last file switch: 4 ms`
- [x] 🟡 Perf regression tests in CI — `find-perf` / `open-perf` / `scroll-perf`
      e2e budgets (repaint counts + median keystroke / warm-open wall clock /
      stall frames), run on Chromium AND Playwright WebKit (the app ships on
      WebKitGTK; Chromium-only budgets hid engine-shaped lag).
- [ ] 🟡 **Perf e2e against the production build** — today's budgets run on the
      vite dev server, where React's dev runtime + GC noise inflate numbers
      ~2×. Add a Playwright project that runs the perf specs against
      `vite build` + `vite preview` so budgets reflect what users feel, then
      tighten them (~half the current bounds).

### Performance architecture — decisions queued (2026-07-05)

Post-mortem of the find-in-diff perf saga (PR #18): nearly every symptom —
mount stalls, pop-in, phantom scrolling on open, find lag scaling with PR
size — traced to ONE architecture choice (render the whole PR as one DOM and
window it by hand) plus ONE platform reality (Linux ships WebKitGTK: no
scroll anchoring, main-thread overflow scrolling, untested-on engine). The
hand-rolled windowing now works and is guarded by e2e, but it is ~400 lines
of incrementally reinvented virtual list: mounted-section set + IO mounting +
height estimates + idle pre-mounter + input yielding + manual scroll
anchoring + section-offset resume + viewport-scoped find marks.

- [x] 🔴 **Replace hand-rolled windowing with react-virtuoso** — its own PR,
      after #18 merges, driven by the existing e2e suite (behavioral + perf +
      page-error guard). Native sticky group headers, variable heights,
      scroll restore, anchoring. Deletes most of the list above and removes
      two ceilings: the 30k-row pre-mount cap and DOM memory scaling with PR
      size; find/scroll costs become viewport-bounded by construction.
      (CodeMirror 6 per file was considered and ruled out: purpose-built but
      a much deeper integration for marginal gain over virtuoso here.)
- [ ] 🟡 **Real-app perf telemetry** — PerformanceObserver (long tasks +
      event timing) feeding the existing perf overlay/store, so regressions
      show up as numbers from the user's machine instead of bug reports that
      start "feels laggy". Every complaint in the saga arrived through feel;
      CI budgets only test the fixtures we thought of.
- [ ] ⏸ **Electron decision trigger** — keep Tauri, but count the cost:
      every time a WebKitGTK-specific issue burns a day (scroll anchoring,
      compositing, the AppImage EGL workaround), tick this item. If it keeps
      ticking, Chromium-everywhere via Electron is the honest fallback —
      ~10× footprint for perf predictability and dev/prod engine parity. Do
      NOT reach for more engine-specific cleverness first.

---

## Flow & navigation — resume first

```
Continue reviewing · Repository X · PR #431 · File 8 / 17
```

No inbox. Just continue.

- [x] 🔴 **Resume where you left off** — default app open.
- [x] 🟡 Auto-advance to next review-requested PR after submit.
- [x] 🟡 **`Esc` → inbox** — exception, not home.

---

## New review notification (stronger than link interception)

Don't wait for Slack links. **The app is where reviews begin.**

When polling finds a new review request:

```
🔔 New review requested

Fix authentication race condition

Press Enter to open
```

Users may never need to click a GitHub link. Pairs with existing 60s polling —
no webhooks required for v1.

- [x] 🟡 **In-app notification** for new review requests — keyboard-dismissable,
      Enter to open. Desktop notification optional later.
- [x] 🟡 **Badge / inbox highlight** for unseen PRs.

---

## Opening a PR — ranked by stage

### Stage 1 — first users (v0.1) ✅

| Method | Flow |
| --- | --- |
| **`mod+k`** | `⌘K → "123" or "login" → Enter` — under a second, no mouse |
| **Resume** | App opens → continue last PR |
| **Inbox** | `j`/`k` + Enter |

Coworkers paste GitHub links in Slack? **Fine.** User copies PR number or title
into `mod+k`. Keyboard-heavy developers may find this *faster* than mouse →
Slack → browser → app.

### Stage 2 — daily users (after v0.1, if needed)

Simple browser extension — **not interception**. ~10% of interception effort,
most of the value:

- **"Open in PR Flow"** button on GitHub/GitLab PR pages (content script)
- Toolbar button + context menu ("Open in PR Flow")
- Calls **`prflow://pr/owner/repo/123`** — register scheme in Tauri app

No native messaging. No auto-intercept. Easy to build and test.

- [ ] 🟡 **Stage 2 extension** — content script + toolbar + `prflow://` handler.
- [ ] 🟡 **Self-hosted GitLab** — user-configurable host patterns in extension.

### Stage 3 — proven pain only (⏸)

**Only if users say:** *"I keep clicking GitHub links and it's annoying."*

- Intercept navigation before GitHub loads
- Native messaging host (bundled with desktop app)
- Close tab immediately · minimize browser flash

Complex: browser API differences, permissions, Slack in-app browser edge cases.
**Do not build until Stage 2 feedback demands it.**

- [ ] ⏸ **Stage 3 interception** + native messaging.
- [ ] ⏸ Universal Links / wrapper domain — only if extension path fails.
- [ ] ⏸ Userscript — lightweight alternative to full extension.

---

## Orient in 2 seconds

One line when relevant: *"2 files changed."* / *"3 new commits."* — skip when N/A.

- [x] 🟡 Orient banner on PR open.

---

## Inbox zero-state

- [x] 🟢 *"Inbox zero — no review requests"* + recent / waiting state.

---

## PR view layout — code-first

**Code** (default) ↔ **Info** (description + PR comments) via **`Tab`**.

- [ ] 🟡 Code-first · Info tab · comment badge.
- [ ] ⏸ Conversation mode (third Tab).

---

## Shortcut scheme

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **`n`** / **`p`** | Next / prev file |
| **`j`** / **`k`** (or `↑` / `↓`) | Next / prev line (cursor) |
| **`Space`** | Page down |
| **`]c`** / **`[c`** | Next / prev comment thread |
| **`c`** | Comment on the cursor line |
| **`e`** | Mark viewed + next file |
| **`v`** | Toggle file viewed |
| **`o`** / **`y`** | Open on GitHub · copy PR link |
| **`i`** | Toggle info panel |
| **`s`** | Submit review |
| **`mod+k`** | **Jump to PR** + commands |
| **`Esc`** | Inbox |

> Shipped keys, matching the app. `mod+t`/`mod+f` (files · find) and `Tab`
> (Code ↔ Info) remain proposed — see § layout.

---

## 6. Command palette — search across PRs

Primary navigation. Inbox optional.

```
⌘K → "Fix login" → Enter
⌘K → "123"       → Enter
⌘K → "john"      → Enter  (author)
```

- [x] 🔴 **`mod+k` PR search** — v0.1 blocker.
- [x] 🟡 PR-context actions — after search works.

---

## 4. Review workflow

- [x] 🟢 **`e`** (viewed + next) · **`v`** (toggle viewed) · files via **`n`** / **`p`**
- [ ] ⏸ Persist pending comments — post-MVP; flaky local drafts worse than none.

### 4b. Verdict v1

Subtle **`8 / 12`** · auto-open verdict when all viewed · no animation · no streaks.

---

## 5. Comments UX

Inline → Code view. PR-level → Info tab + badge. ⏸ Conversation mode.

- [x] 🟢 Thread hotkeys — `r` reply / `x` resolve on the hovered or
      `]c`-focused thread; hints fade in on the thread's own action buttons.
- [x] 🟢 Composer hint-bar toolbar — ⌘B/⌘I/⌘K markdown wrapping + ⌘⇧P
      in-place live preview; entries are clickable hints, not GitHub's
      14-icon strip.
- [ ] 🔴 **Multi-line comment ranges (GitLab-style)** — its own branch; the
      anchoring model changes end-to-end. Spec (2026-07-06):
      - *Selection model:* a line range is a "fat cursor" — `shift+j`/`shift+k`
        (and shift+arrows) extend from the cursor line; `Esc` collapses; `c`
        comments on the range. Mouse: press the gutter `+` and drag (one
        pointer-capture handler feeding the same range state). The iris
        left-rail accent stretches over the selected rows.
      - *Composer:* header reads `Lines 12–15 · RIGHT`; "Suggestion" prefills
        the fence with **all** selected rows (this is where multi-line earns
        its keep). Range must be one side and one hunk-contiguous run.
      - *Plumbing:* `start_line`/`start_side` + `line`/`side` on the GitHub
        review-comment API (GitLab: `line_range`), rust `github.rs`/`gitlab.rs`
        payloads, `PendingComment` gains optional `startLine`, comment items
        anchor to the range's END row in `buildReviewItems`, and
        `rowContent` becomes the joined range for suggestion prefill.
      - *Tests:* e2e for shift+j extend → c → prefilled multi-line fence;
        drag path; pending-comment persistence round-trip with `startLine`.

## 7. Data freshness

60s polling + refetch on focus. No **`r`** key. No sync UI.

- [x] 🟢 Remove manual refresh.
- [x] 🟡 Banner when open PR changes externally.
- [ ] ⏸ Webhooks — post-MVP.

---

## 8. shadcn/ui — Phase 1

- [ ] 🟡 `command`, `dialog`, `tooltip` — incremental with MVP modals.

## 11. Distribution & adoption

### 11a. Opening PRs from GitHub/GitLab links — staged

**Raw `https://github.com/.../pull/N` links cannot be OS-hijacked** (you don't
own github.com). Options exist on a **complexity ladder** — climb only as users
prove the need.

| Stage | What | Slack click → app? | Build when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `mod+k` + resume + notifications | N/A — don't use Slack link | **v0.1** |
| **2** | Extension: "Open in PR Flow" on PR page | Browser → one click → app | Daily users |
| **3** | Interception + native messaging | Brief flash → app | Users ask for it |

**Stage 2 UX (good enough):** user clicks GitHub link in Slack → lands on GitHub
→ clicks **"Open in PR Flow"** (or toolbar) → app opens. One extra click, ~10%
of Stage 3 effort.

**Stage 3 UX (best for raw links):** click → brief browser flash → app. Only
worth it after validation.

- [ ] 🟡 **`prflow://` scheme** — register via `tauri-plugin-deep-link`; used by
      Stage 2 extension button.
- [ ] 🟡 **Link-open hydration** — when app opens from any source: cache-first
      paint, restore file/scroll/viewed.
- [ ] ⏸ Stage 2 extension (content script + toolbar + context menu).
- [ ] ⏸ Stage 3 interception + native messaging.
- [ ] ⏸ Universal Links / wrapper domain.

### 11b. Auto-updates

- [~] 🔴 Before external users — `tauri-plugin-updater` + CI releases.
      *Plugin + in-app prompt scaffolded; real signing key, feed & CI signing remain (see README "Auto-updates").*
- [ ] ⏸ Crash reporting.

## Notes / cross-cutting

- **Inside > entry.** Polish review flow before Slack link magic.
- **`mod+k` is the v0.1 answer** to "coworker pasted a GitHub link" — PR number
  or title, Enter, done.
- **Notifications > interception** — app tells you about new reviews; you don't
  need Slack to be the entry point.
- Stage 2 extension is a **delighter**, not foundational — ship without it.
- Stage 3 is **technically cool** but high maintenance — zero users have asked yet.
- First testers will complain about comment jumps, Escape, slowness, memory — not
  missing link interception.

## Parked ideas (2026-07-02)

- **Subscribed repos**: watch chosen repositories (not just PRs involving you) —
  a fifth inbox source, likely per-account repo picker + polling. Shape TBD.
